Jordan King - Data Analytics Portfolio
Hi there! I'm Jordan King, a data analytics professional with a Bachelors of Science in Business Data Analytics, which I completed in July 2022. I'm passionate about uncovering insights from data and helping businesses make data-driven decisions.  I value efficency and approaching problems from unique angles. With extensive experience in Excel, Tableau, Python, and Power BI, I've honed my skills in data cleaning, manipulation, visualization, and reporting.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I've worked with large datasets, developed interactive dashboards in Tableau, and participated in two hackathons where I collaborated with teammates to solve complex business problems using data.
